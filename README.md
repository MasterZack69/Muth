# Muth
A simple and ez to use mathematical library for C++( this project **"was"** full of shit )
Here you can get basic mathamatical operational functions like area and volume with **Hindi** output ;).You can read **doc.txt** to get the names of those functions and to know what do they do. It does not have trigonometry becuz me noob.....;-;
