# Muth
A simple and ez to use mathematical library for C++( this project **"was"** full of shit )

# What's New??
I changed all those functions with hindi output and also changed there names in hinglish.

You can read **doc.txt** to get the names of those functions and to know what do they do.
This library has basic mathematical operations covered like area and volume, it doesn't have parameters because it's for kids(I was too lazy to add them :|)
And it also does not have trigonometry becuz me noob.....;-;

Hope You like my project;)

# IT'S MUTH 2.69!!!!!!
